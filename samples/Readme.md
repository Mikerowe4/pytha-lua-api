- Cube Sample

  For a truly minimal sample with an interactive user interface, take a look at this sample. The dialog of this sample is also discussed [here](https://github.com/daniel-flassig/pytha-lua-api/wiki/pyui-First-Dialog).

- Game of Life

  This is a fun little sample that runs J. H. Conway's Game of Life inside PYTHA. The fields are represented by cubes.
  
- Menger Sponge

  This sample creates a [Menger Sponge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger_sponge) of arbitrary size and level.
