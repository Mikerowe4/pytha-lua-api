## Plugin Installation

A PYTHA Plugin is represented by a folder. The name of that folder is the display name of the plugin. To install a plugin, move its folder into `PYTHA-Settings-Directory\plugins`, where `PYTHA-Settings-Directory` is the folder that you can access from PYTHA-Central. In a standard installation, you can find it at `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\PYTHA25.0`.
